## About
This repository contains the scripts used in the classification of the agriculture theme, for the Collection 5 of Mapbiomas. We recommend that you read the  [Agriculture Appendix of the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://mapbiomas.org/download-dos-atbds), since important informations about the classification methodology can be found in there. For this collection, we have the following agriculture subclasses:

 - Temporary Crop
	- Soybean (2000 - 2019)
	- Sugar Cane
	- Other Temporary Crop (includes soybean before 2000)
 - Perennial Crop

## How to use

First, you need to copy the scripts in this repository  (including those in [utils folder](./utils)) to your Google Earth Engine (**GEE**) account. Then, you can follow the instructions for every subclass in the links bellow:
																						 
 - [Soybean](./soybean) instructions;
 - [Sugar Cane](./sugarcane) instructions.
 - [Other Temporary and Perennial Crops](./temporary-perennial-crops) instructions;
